# TheLibraryIsOpenUIKit

This is a recreation of [TheLibraryIsOpen](https://github.com/rafaelclaycon/TheLibraryIsOpen) using [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) instead of [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) as the UI framework.

## Ok, but why?

This is meant as a study of [CleanSwift](https://clean-swift.com/clean-swift-ios-architecture/?utm_source=pocket_mylist) ([eat shit, Uncle Bob](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/robert-martin)) and, as an added benefit, can also run on iOS < 13 (which means iPhone 5s and iPad Air are still supported, [hey how are you](https://youtu.be/7gDKbT_l2us)).
